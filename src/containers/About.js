    <p>We Believe the Bible to be the only inspired, infallible, and authoritative Word of God. We understand the Old Testament to be the recorded history of God's people, pointing to the coming of his Son, Jesus. We understand the New Testament, to be the only authoritative will of God (2 Timothy 3:16-17).</p>

    <p>We Believe Jesus is the head of His church (Ephesians 1:22-23) with authority over her life and doctrine (John 14:6).</p>
    
    <p>We Believe there is only one God who is the creator of the heavens and the earth. God is exists in three personalities: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Deuteronomy 4:39).</p>
    
    <p>We Believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus the Christ, His virgin birth, His sinless life, His miracles, His death on the cross, and His resurrection from the dead (1 John 5:1).</p>
    
  <p> We Believe that salvation cannot be earned. However, through God's grace and Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross, we are redeemed through our faith in Jesus (Ephesians 2:8-9).</p>
    
    <p>We Believe Baptism to be the beginning of the New Life. The word baptism comes from the Greek word “baptizo” and means, “to dip, to immerse, or to plunge.” We practice immersion because it was practiced by the New Testament church. And, only immersion conforms to the description of baptism found in Romans 6:1-4, where it is connected to the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus.</p>
