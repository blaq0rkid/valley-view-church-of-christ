    <p>We want to thank you for visiting our site. We hope you enjoy learning more about God and us. If you have any questions, we would love to hear from you. You can contact any of our elders, or our ministers, via email or phone.</p>

    <p>If you are able to visit us, we would personally like to invite you to come out and worship with us on a Sunday morning. It is our goal to earnestly seek God in all that we do. Our objective is recorded by the Hebrew writer, "And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him." (NIV, Hebrews 11:6)</p>
    
    <p>We would also like you to know, <strong>you are important to God</strong>, and you are therefore, important to us. So, if you have any questions, or need anything, we want to hear from you. We realize some people have physical needs from time to time, but we are certain everyone has spiritual needs all the time. So, most importantly, we want to attend to your spiritual needs.</p>
    
    <p>We look forward to meeting you soon, but if we never meet, we wish for you all of God's love.</p>
